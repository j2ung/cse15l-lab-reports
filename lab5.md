# Lab 5 - Putting it All Together

## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

Student

Hello, I am having trouble with my code. Here is the error I am getting:
![Image](lab5-ss1.png)

I am trying to make a filter and merge method. I want it the filter to return a new list containing the filtered strings while preserving their original order. As for the merge, I want it to take two sorted lists of strings and merges them into a single list while maintaining sorted order.

## Part 2 - Reflection  
  * One of the things I learned during the last half of the quarter, was the basics of `vim`. Before, I knew nothiing of `vim`. Now, I know a few things like `i` to edit, `:wq`to save changes, and `:q!` to quit without changes. I also learned how to commit and push changes onto Git repositiories. It makes collabortive coding more organized and efficient.
