## Part 2 - Reflection  
  * One of the things I learned during the last half of the quarter, was the basics of `vim`. Before, I knew nothiing of `vim`. Now, I know a few things like `i` to edit, `:wq`to save changes, and `:q!` to quit without changes. I also learned how to commit and push changes onto Git repositiories. It makes collabortive coding more organized and efficient.
